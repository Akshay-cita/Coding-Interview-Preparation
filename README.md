## Day-2: Base25 to Base10 conversion
Consider a base 26 system wherein the letters of the alphabets are the digits.

That is A=0, B=1, C=2….Z=25 in base 10

Write a program that will take an input string of alphabets, use the first half of the string as a number in the base26 system and the other half as another number in the base26 system.Now, add these two numbers to obtain a sum in base10.
Accept the string only if it contains even number of characters otherwise, return 0.

Example:-  If your input string is “Petpan”, then first split it into PET26 and PAN26. And show the sum in base10.
# Sample Input

“Petpan”

# Sample Output
20416
